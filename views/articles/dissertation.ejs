            <h1>National Security versus EU Data Protection Compliance: The Cases of the EU-US National Data Transfer Agreements and the Schrems cases</h1>
            <h2>Abstract </h2>

            <p>
Government surveillance has become both complex and controversial, with the famous cases of the Snowden Disclosures 
revealing the U.S. surveillance programmes and the questions it creates for the privacy and data protection of 
foreign citizens using the internet. The value of surveillance to U.S. national security is
in direct conflict with the EU privacy and data protection standards, creating a need for a new agreement between the 
U.S. and the EU in the current absence of data transfer tool for U.S. and EU companies. But which side would need to 
compromise so a new agreement can be reached? This paper aims to provide an answer to this question in the challenge of 
such a complicated issue.

            </p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Surveillance has been around for a long time, with the roots of modern surveillance, being traced back to ancient civilizations that kept records for taxation, military service, immigration, and apportioning land (Elnahla and Neilson, 2021). The use of surveillance is commonly criticised for its infringement on privacy. Privacy is a fundamental human right, concerning everyone, and that technological developments have almost always put this in danger (Georgieva, I. 2015).  
                Technological developments, especially computerization, have been profoundly important in the rise of new forms of surveillance (Haggerty and Ericson, 2006). A recent case of this is when the Five Eyes alliance, an intelligence alliance made up of the UK, U.S. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, alongside India and Japan, released an international statement on end-to-end encryption (Dizon and McHugh, 2022). The statement proposed technology companies to design or modify encrypted messaging services to permit law enforcement to intercept and access the decrypted communications of their user’s communications (Dizon and McHugh, 2022). 
                This can also be seen though the case study of China. China has developed the social credit system; it scores individuals and companies based on factors such as ‘creditworthiness’ and ‘trustworthiness’ based of computational methods on history and ongoing activities (Liang, et al. 2018). These operations in combination with big data innovations, and information and communication technologies are used by the government for surveillance and the governing of social and commercial dominions of China (Liang, et al. 2018).
                It is evident from as early as 90s that the power of governmental and private organisations to compel the disclosure, analysis and distribution of personal information was growing rapidly (Marx, 1998). </p>
                <p>
                This paper explores the issues surrounding the government surveillance operation of the U.S. government and how this has affected EU international data transfers and the perception of government surveillance operations. This dissertation explores the Snowden disclosures and the Schrems cases to figure out why the agreements between the EU and U.S. have failed. The relevant legislation surrounding the Schrems cases are covered and will serve to understand the results produced from research undertaken.
                
                The research serves to answer the ethicality of U.S. foreign surveillance and for similar third countries involved with international data transfers with the EU. Finally, the research will address which party, the U.S. foreign surveillance operations or the EU data protection and privacy standards should yield so that a new agreement can be made for international transfers of data between the U.S. and the EU.
                </p>
            <h2>Aims and Objectives </h2>
            <p>This paper has three main objectives, firstly it aims to determine the sort of impact the U.S. creates, most importantly on citizens when using foreign internet surveillance operations, primarily from the U.S. surveillance practices disclosed by Edward Snowden. 
                Secondly this paper identifies the effect EU data protection standards have, most importantly on the U.S. ability to protect its national security. 
                Lastly this paper evaluates the value of privacy and data protection of EU citizens against the value of U.S. foreign internet surveillance operations for national security.
                By fulfilling these objectives, this dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ethical, and economic implications of U.S. government surveillance and to offer recommendations for how governments can balance security concerns with respect for privacy and civil liberties.
                </p>

            <p> 
                ⦁	To evaluate the ethical implications of U.S. foreign internet surveillance
                ⦁	To evaluate the ethical implications of enforcing EU data protection standards

                Literature Review
            </h2>
            <p>This literature review explores the background behind the conflict involved with international data transfers between the U.S. and the EU. This includes the Snowden revelations and the Schrems cases. This Literature review begins by figuring out one of the primary elements behind the EUs decisions behind the Schrems cases, the right to privacy, and the right to data protection. The review then looks at some aspect of privacy in relation to surveillance and its relationship, including the privacy paradox and the panopticon studies, factors that can used when analysing the data gathered within the research. The Snowden leaks inform the reader of this paper of the way U.S. agencies used foreign surveillance enabled by U.S. companies and the internet. The motivation of this dissertation is the result of the Schrems cases, and the problems discovered by those cases relating to EU U.S. data transfers.</p>
            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>The concept of privacy has been considered and defined in very different disciplines including descriptive, empirical, and normative perspectives (Trepte, 2021). 
            </p>
            <p>In 1890, Warren and Brandeies’s Titled “The Right to Privacy: The Implicit Made Explicit,” essay is the first attempt to establish privacy as a category of immunity under U.S. law (Adams, 2009 p. 1-30). Within this essay privacy was considered a human right, with Judge Cooley calling it the “right to be left alone” (Trepte, 2021).  </p>
            <p>Because of the advancement of civilisation, somebodies’ pain, pleasure, and profit of things did not count for just physical entities. These emotions and sensations relating to non-physical entities demanded legal recognition, making the development of the law inevitable (Adams, 2009 p. 1-30). This is seen through their argument over the press, at the time was overstepping its boundaries for propriety and decency, and that newspapers invasion of privacy is problematic and evil, calling for remedies to the circulation of unauthorised portraits (Warren and Brandeies, 1890).</p>
            <p>The definition of privacy grew more specific, later defined as “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others” or “the selective control of access to the self” (Trepte, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>The right to privacy is brought into the question when coming under fire by internet surveillance, and so what is protected by the right to privacy? Issues labelled as concerns by lawyers and philosophers show widely different views about the scope of the right and the kinds of cases that fall under its purview (Marmor, 2015). Because of this, it has become difficult to articulate the underlying interest that is protected by the right to privacy making some philosophers doubt that there are any underlying interests protected by it (Marmor, 2015). 
            </p>
            <p>How should privacy on the internet be protected, and to what extent does privacy apply? Rumbold & Wilson (2019) analyse the matter of public information on the internet, privacy and monitoring systems that use public information. Rumbold & Wilson (2019) explain a traditional philosophy within privacy that states privacy only applies to information that is private, also private information that has been made public no longer remains private, and so these systems that monitor the public information available on the internet does not affect privacy through this traditional philosophy. </p>
            <h2>Personal Data and Privacy in the EU
            </h2>
            <p>Data transfers include transfers of personal data, but what is personal data and why is its protection considered a right within the EU?</p>
            <p>“Personal Data” from Art. 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)” (General Data Protection Regulation, 2018).  The definition includes indicators “such as name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the physical, psychological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” (General Data Protection Regulation, 2018).  
            </p>
            <p>When a person uses a software system, they will consciously or unconsciously exchange the data they provide during use for the benefits received from the system (Brunotte, et al. 2023). Because of sensing, communication, and interacting devices collecting and processing large amounts of information about people’s everyday lives, the EU has deemed necessary the protection of the right to privacy and personal data protection (van Dijk, et al. 2018). These protections are specified in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (van Dijk, et al. 2018). The EU decision to protect personal data can been understood when comparing the large amount of data being collected on people’s everyday lives to the more recent definition of privacy that states how individuals have selective control to determine for themselves “when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others”. However, as seen in the Privacy Paradox, maybe this right is not as important to individuals as it may seem.</p>
            <h2>Privacy Paradox</h2>
            <p>More than thirty years have passed since the publishing of Warren and Brandeies’s essay, and new relationships with privacy have been created, namely the relationship of privacy and the internet. What does the average person think about their privacy and how it is affected by the internet? This brings up the privacy paradox. With most of the research into the privacy paradox involving e commerce and general internet activities (Barth & de Jong, 2017). The privacy paradox is a phenomenon described by users claiming to be very concerned about privacy but do very little to protect their personal data and by that documented fact, take part in privacy compromising behaviour (Barth & de Jong, 2017).  </p>
            <h2>Surveillance</h2>
            <p>The panopticon is a model for effective surveillance and self-imposed control (Hakkala, A. & Koskinen, J. 2022). The main idea behind the panopticon is that the perception of surveillance can be just as effective as surveillance itself, no matter if it is perceived or real. When an individual believes they are under surveillance they will change their behaviour to match the perception of surveillance regardless of it being real or not (Hakkala, A. & Koskinen, J. 2022). This idea of the panopticon will be used to evaluate the way U.S. surveillance operations operate. </p>
            <p>Surveillance as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary is to “Watch or guard kept over a person, etc., esp, over a suspected person, a prisoner, or the like; often, spying supervision; less commonly supervision for the purpose of direction or control, superintendence.”.  The surveillance activities carried out by state institutions include secret services and the police that monitor criminals, political activists, enemies of the state, and companies that track workers, customers, and competitors (Fuchs & Trottier 2017).</p>
            <p>This dissertation looks at the U.S. foreign surveillance and will be defined as a form of mass surveillance. (Hakkala & Koskinen, 2022) provide a definition for mass surveillance that states “[. . . ] the surveillance of groups of people, usually large groups. In general, the reason for investigation or monitoring is to identify individuals who belong to some particular class of interest to the surveillance organisation.”. This definition contrasts with the wording of the Oxford dictionary, where Oxford focuses on “a person” the mass surveillance definition makes it capable of applying to broad range individuals and can seemingly be conducted on anyone (Hakkala & Koskinen, 2022). This is shown in how the U.S. uses bulk surveillance techniques, as discussed in the Snowden Revelations and the Schrems cases, where these programmes can capture a massive amount of data on foreign citizens who are not necessarily suspected of a crime.</p>
            <p>Surveillance has become ‘multifaceted and chaotic’, and so at risk of stretching the analytical category of “surveillance” itself surpasses any recognition (Klauser, 2006). Klauser (2006) explains how the assumption in the increase of aims, agendas, institutions, objects, and agents of surveillance has made it difficult to say anything about surveillance. However as of more recent, and explained by (Bauman, et al. 2014) “critical security studies” have already criticized views of surveillance for being a tool that serves the most powerful actors and interests.</p>
            <p>Surveillance tools are seen present in a person’s daily activities. Private monitoring infrastructures are now thoroughly embedded in the daily lives of many, present in smart phones and other portable networked devices, smart speakers, smart cameras, and a growing range of systems that provide convenience and efficiency with increasingly comprehensive forms of data capture (Andrejevic, M. 2019). This paper therefore narrows this focus on the U.S. foreign surveillance programs including, PRISM, Upstream and Tempora, and how this is affecting the internet, international data transfers, and the privacy of users of the internet. 
            </p>
            <p>This leads into the next section of the literature review that will go into detail how these surveillance programs work and how they were revealed to the world.</p>
            <h2>Snowden Revelations</h2>
            <p>For surveillance to be most effective it is done in secrete, however in June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed with the help of The Guadian, leaked documents showing the many mass internet surveillance systems from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) (Fuchs & Trottier, 2017). The information disclosed was extensive, covering the practices of NSA regarding PRISM and other U.S. surveillance programmes, including Upstream, Quantuminsert, Bullrun, Tempora, XKeyscore and Dishfire (Bauman, et al. 2014). </p>
            <p>The disclosure also documents the involvement of other states, for example the UK Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) and the Tempora and Optic Nerve programmes (Bauman et al. 2014). The NSA programme Upstream and the GCHQ Tempora programme is used to harvest data from internet cables with, or to intercept the data during travel (Bauman, et al. 2014). The UK GCHQ Tempora programme, behaves similarly to Upstream, tapping into cable and networks, and together can intercept any internet traffic (Lyon, 2014). XKeyscore is the database allowing information to be extracted in real time (Lyon, 2014).</p>
            <p>The leaks show how the NSA PRISM programme obtained direct access to user data from numerous ICT companies including AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Paltalk, Skype, Yahoo!, and Microsoft (Fuchs & Trottier, 2017). This means that the encryption and privacy controls used to protect user privacy where circumvented, aided by organisations, and handed over to surveillance systems including PRISM (Lyon, 2014). </p>
            <p>A separate report was leaked to the Washington Post in August 2013, exposing the National Security Agency (NSA), violating its own privacy rules 2,776 times in the timescale of a year (de Goede, 2014).</p>
            <p>The significance of this information remains unclear, partly due to the extensive details about the exposed complex systems are difficult to track, however many of these systems seem to have serious and immediate consequences (Bauman, et al. 2014). For instance, the leaks also show how the Britain’s Government Communications Headquarter (GCHQ), monitored, and collected communication, phone and Internet data from fibre optic cables and shared such data with the NSA (Fuchs & Trottier, 2017). Not only that, but the network of secret government also spying partnerships showed how the UK used existing domestic guarantees, such as with the U.S. to spy on their own citizens through a back door (Georgieva, 2015). Ever since Edward Snowden’s revelations, privacy concerns have become integral to the international agenda, transforming the data protection of individuals into a global issue (Fuchs, & Trottier, 2017).</p>
            <h2>Laws Governing EU data transfers.</h2>
            <p>To understand why international agreements between the U.S. and EU were invalidated in the Schrems cases, it is necessary to identify the instruments protecting personal data and privacy within the EU. This is to understand how EU data protection standards works and how the agreement ensures an equivalent level of protection when data is transferred to the U.S. This information will also be useful in understanding why U.S. foreign surveillance was responsible in the invalidation of these agreements.</p>
            <p>The European Union model of data protection regulation has had a major impact on laws and practices adopted worldwide (Murphy, 2022). The EU has established itself with a role in shaping how the world thinks about data privacy (Murphy, 2022).</p>
            <P>This can be seen through the EU undergoing the development of instruments and enforcement regimes, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Privacy Sheild, and the agreement known as the EU-US Umbrella agreement, in response to the Snowden Revelations (Fahey & Terpan, 2021). </P>
            <h2>GDPR</h2>
            <P>The GDPR legislation came into force in May 2018 and effects all EU countries (Truong, et al. 2020). The GDPR is an update to the data privacy regulations released in 1995, including the data protection directive, addressing the development of cloud platforms, social media, and the scale of current data usage (Truong, et al. 2020). Its provision ensures that personal data “can only be gathered legally, under strict conditions, for a legitimate purpose”; as well as to bring full control back to the data owners.” (Truong, et al. 2020). 
            </P>
            <P>Article 1 (1) of the GDPR explains that it “lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.” (General Data Protection Regulation, 2018). 
            </P>
            <P>Article 1 (2) states the regulation “protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.” (General Data Protection Regulation, 2018).</P>
            <P>The guidance aims to protect the rights and freedoms of people, especially for the protection of their personal data. Therefore, what does the GDPR say about the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S.?  </P>
            <P>A fundamental principle of EU data protection law is that personal data to be transferred outside the EU to jurisdiction of third countries can only do so under certain conditions (Murphy, 2022). the GDPR provides ways in which data transfers can be facilitated, for example data can be transferred to a third country based on an ‘adequacy decision’ where the commission has determined that the third country ensures an ‘adequate level of protection’ for personal data (Murphy, 2022). </P>
            <P>The GDPR requirements are highly abstract, and open to interpretation (Truong, N. B. et al. 2020). Because of this, every organisation has different ways of satisfying the regulations and demonstrating compliance (Truong, et al. 2020). For example, the UK implements the guidelines within the GDPR with its data protection act 2018.</P>
            <H2>U.S. data protection</H2>
            <P>In comparison to the EU, there is no unifying or comprehensive U.S. federal data privacy law and no privacy right of action, instead data protection is segmented by industry and more related to consumer protection (Flor, 2021). Flor (2021) provides examples in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), where healthcare data of individuals is strictly regulated and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) that governs student education data. Because this approach is fragmented, the question becomes where a right to data privacy might originate (Flor, 2021).</P>
            <P>Although the U.S. has no federal data privacy right, some states have begun implementing legislation for certain rights to consumers regarding the management of their personal information (Flor, 2021). The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) came into effect in 2020, and is loosely modelled after the GDPR, bringing the same principles into its framework, but maintains a consumer protection perspective (Flor, 2021). 
            </P>
            <h2>Privacy Shield</h2>
            <p>Section 14 of the Commission Implementing Decision of 12 July 2016 explains that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is based on a system of self-certification where U.S. organisations commit to a set of privacy principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2016). These principles apply to both controllers and processors. Processors “must be contractually bound to act only on instructions from the EU processor” and assist the EU controller “in responding to individuals exercising their rights under the Principles” (COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2016).</p>
            <p>The adequacy decision has seven annexes from U.S. government entities that implement various commitments and requirements, for example increased data subject protections, and increased requirements to respect data protection principles (Voss, 2016). 
            </p>
            <p>The GDPR, EU-US Umbrella Agreement, and Privacy Shield, were important global data transfer instruments, with enormous regulatory influence across the Atlantic, until July 2020 when Privacy Shield was invalidated (Fahey & Terpan, 2021).</p>
            <p>The invalidation of these agreements has stemmed from the Snowden disclosures and the application of U.S. governments surveillance operations, as will be covered in the Schrems cases later in this dissertation. But what part of the U.S. law allows government agencies to operate their surveillance activities? </p>
            <h2>FISA Section 702 and Executive Order 12333 United States Intelligence Activities</h2>
            <p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Section 702 is the main authority for PRISM, and similar NSA surveillance programmes (Wen, 2016). Section 702 gives the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence together the power to authorise for up to one year the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be outside of the U.S. for the collection of foreign intelligence information (Donohue, 2014). However, the framing of foreign intelligence collection activities does not come from FISA but instead the Executive Order 12,333 (EO 12,333) (Donohue, 2014).</p>
            <p>EO 12,333, entitled ‘United States Intelligence Activities’ mandates the way in which the intelligence community is to conduct its activities, how the cooperative assistance of an agency may be given to another agency, and the limitations on the intelligence community’s participation in domestic organisations activities (Newman & van Geel, 1989). However (Wen, 2016) explains that the provision’s lack of specificity has caused congressional intelligence communities to receive less information about EO 12,333 resulting in a limited oversight in at least two respects. The first limitation is the inability to stay informed of EO 12,333 activities, and its lack of authority to direct or prevent intelligence collection (Wen, 2016).
            </p>
            <h2>
                Presidential Policy Directive 28 
            </h2>
            <p>Issued on 17 January 2014, the Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28) enforces limitations on ‘signals intelligence’ operations, limiting the U.S. intelligence authorities (Wen, 2016). This is like EO-12,333 as it should offer some level of protection from unhinged levels of mass surveillance. However, this will be called into question as shown in the Schrems cases.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Schrems Cases
            </h2>
            <p>The Schrems cases have managed to invalidate international agreements between the EU and the U.S. on two separate occasions. These cases bring attention to the surveillance practices operated by the U.S. and why they do not comply with the EU’s standards for data protection. The U.S. laws that allow government organisations to collect and process data on EU citizens, including Section 702 of FISA come into direct conflict with the EU’s standards and at the same time these standards come into conflict with the U.S. ability to use such operations for national security.</p>
            <p>This section covers the cases of Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems (c-363/14) and Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd and Maximillian Schrems (c-311/18), otherwise known as Schrems I and Schrems II.</p>
            <p>The Snowden revelations had inspired the data activist Maximillian Schrems, who focused his complaints on Facebook, and whether Facebook’s transfers of personal data to the U.S. complied with the Data Protection Directive (the Directive) of the European Parliament and of the council of 24 on individuals’ protection regarding the processing of personal data and on the freedom of movement of that data (Hoffman, 2021).</p>
            <p>Despite Facebook owning data centres in Europe, Facebook transfers data from the EU to the U.S. to operate its business (Hoffman, 2021). Schrems took several complaints against Facebook to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), on the grounds of, among other things, Facebook’s involvement with Safe Harbour (Kuner, 2017). Schrems complaints alleged there was no meaningful protection in U.S. privacy law regarding intelligence surveillance (Kuner, 2017). The DPC could not question the adequacy of Safe Harbour with regards to Article 25(6) of the Directive (Kuner, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards the case was submitted to the High Court of Ireland with its evaluation being accepted by the Court of Justice in the European Union (CJEU). Despite this, the CJEU declared the Safe Harbour decision invalid (Bu-Pasha, 2017). The CJEU had found the Safe Harbour Agreement did not ensure “an adequate level of protection” for transfers to the U.S. under the Data Privacy Directive (Flor A. 2021).</p>
            <p>In Schrems II, Privacy Shield was like Safe Harbour, the same uncertainty was called into question concerning the ability of companies to safely transfer data internationally to the U.S. (Hoffman, 2021). Privacy Shield had increased protections for EU subjects compared to Safe Harbour, such as the improved oversight on data processing in the U.S. with broader remedies for violations (Hoffman, 2021). </p>
            <p>The CJEU observed the Presidential Policy Directive 28 ‘does not grant data subjects actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities.’ and concluded that same of Executive Order 12333, in addition it ‘does not confer rights which are enforceable against the US authorities in the courts either.’ (Chander, 2020). </p>
            <p>The CJEU argued the failure to ‘delimit in a sufficiently clear and precise manner the scope of such bulk collection of personal data.’ (Chander, 2020). 
                Furthermore, the CJEU reasoned that Section 702 of FISA and Executive Order 12333, together fail to provide for a proportionality assessment sufficient for ensuring the collection and use of EU subjects personal data by U.S. intelligence agencies is limited by what is necessary and fail to provide the legal remedies for EU subjects in cases where personal data is misused in U.S. surveillance programmes (Gacutan, 2022).
            </p>
            <p>These factors determined the CJEU to conclude the invalidation of the Privacy Shield Decision on the grounds of failing to ensure essentially equivalent levels of protection to that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Gacutan, 2022).</p>
            <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
            <p>This section will discuss the methodologies used in data collection and analysis, and how both work towards fulfilling the aim of this dissertation.
            </p>
            <p>The research planning is constructed from the research onion, provided by Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill (2019). Using the research onion model, research techniques and procedures, time horizon, strategy, methodological choice, approach to theory development and philosophy are chosen and shown in Figure 1.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/Capture.PNG" alt="methodology onion" width="500" height="600">
            <p>This research onion diagram is incorporated to visualize all the aspects of the research methodology needed to complete the following research. This visualization of the chosen decisions can be seen in Figure 2, a research onion created for this research.</p>
            <img src="/images/Capture2.PNG" alt="methodology onion 2" width="500" height="600">
            <p>This paper takes a qualitative research approach. The research will be conducted as an if it was an open-ended survey. Responses may not be grounded in a uniformly accepted reality, the responses will have different findings, conclusions, and opinions. Questions are created before the research begins. Answers are then found in documentary publicly available libraries and will consist of peer reviewed academic journals when research is conducted. This makes the data collected in this paper secondary data that uses the pre-existing works relating to internet surveillance. </p>
            <p>The research approach taken in this dissertation is induction as seen in Figure 2. Inductive analysis primarily has a descriptive and exploratory orientation, for example “what do x people think about y?” (Cassell, et al. 2018). This can be applied to the research question, substituting x for “academics”, and y for “problems created from the U.S. foreign surveillance operations”.</p>
            <p>This research uses inductive coding techniques. Inductive coding is a data analysis process in which the researcher reads and interprets raw textual data to develop themes, concepts or a process model through interpretations based on data (Chandra, Yanto, and Liang Shang, 2019). </p>
            <p>The inductive coding approach generally relies on inductive reasoning, so that critical themes, topics or models appear from raw data through repeated examination and comparison (Chandra, Yanto, and Liang Shang, 2019). This starts by organising the raw data, this can be from academic articles, news articles, interview transcripts, marketing reports or other material through first-order coding or open coding processes (Chandra, Yanto, and Liang Shang, 2019). 
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, this research will organise raw data from academic articles, using the inductive coding process and then repeatedly examining and comparing the raw data to develop important themes to fulfil the aim of this dissertation.
            </p>
            <h2>Time Scale</h2>
            <p>The academic literature included within the first and second question spans from the date of the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013 up until the modern day, meaning the research included in this paper includes a time scale of approximately ten years of research on the topic. </p>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>The first question is “What problems are created from U.S. foreign surveillance operations?”.</p>
            <p>This will identify the problems for EU citizens and the U.S. companies involved in the handling of EU data subjects’ personal data and responsibilities for data protection.
            </p>
            <p>The second question asks, “What problems are created from EU data protection standards?”.</p>
            <p>
                This question will identify problems surrounding the EU attempting to maintain its data protection and privacy standards inside the U.S. and the problems created for the U.S. government.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <h2>What problems are created from U.S. foreign surveillance operations?</h2>
            <p>R_1 creates an analogy for the ethicality of owners of IT companies allowing government access to their data, see Appendix A. R_1 compares this to builder making a house, making it secure against burglary and then being forced to implement entry for the law enforcement agencies for when the house is locked so that they can enter at any time they want. Something this controversial is comparable to the use of foreign surveillance practices in the U.S. R_1 explains that one might conclude that proceeding with activities such as cross-border data transfer cannot be done safely on the assumption that law enforcement with a duly served warrant can never be a “bad actor”, see Appendix A.</p>
            <p>R_2 predicts that if there is no effort to stabilise internet surveillance operations the world will remain dominated under the U.S. global multistakeholder organisation named Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for another fifteen years, creating uncertainty in the internal security of nations, and battles over the sovereignty of public policies, see Appendix B.</p>
            <p>R_3 explains how the chilling and direct effects of Government, security companies, and media playing on with the fear factor. Fear helps corporations sell security equipment, and government that view their operations as allowing free market and maintaining security. R_3 explains the polarisation created by the media, the “good guys versus bad guys”, this of which can be seen by the characterisation of “bad” in “Muslim” terms. R_3 give an example, when politicians or journalists not clearly distinguish between terrorists and those who are legal protestors, such as against human rights abuses, aboriginal exploitation, and undocumented migrants. Finally, R _3 concludes, the amount of fear disproportionally outweighs the statistics of terrorist activity, R_3 argues this fear encourages an acceptance of intensified surveillance, see Appendix C.</p>
            <p>R_9 reiterates the findings of the Strasbourg judges, that surveillance can’t be considered as the ‘dues ex machina’ for curbing terrorism and serious crimes, while warning of a future nightmarish Orwellian society, see Appendix I.</p>
            <p>R_10 explains that people are angry because of how their privacy has been violated for years, when at the same time the U.S. government advocating privacy as a human right that should be protected at all costs. R_10 give an example of Hillary Clinton who quoted Franklin Roosevelt’s speech of 1941 and his global vision where ‘all people enjoyed freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear’ adding new freedoms to his list, including the freedom to connect and share ideas, to form communities, using the internet for commerce, banking, etc. R_10 explains that the freedom to connect comes with mass surveillance, which creates fear despite Roosevelts advocation for the ‘freedom from fear’, see Appendix J.</p>
            <h2>What problems are created from EU data protection standards?</h2>
            <p>R_4 explains how legislation concerning public safety, defence, national security, and criminal law including the access to personal data by public authorities are “Indisputably matters of public sovereignty”. R_4 points out the confusion surrounding the EU Commission granting or refusing something as important as data transfers based on that third countries legislation. On the other hand, R_4 explains that is the right to data protection is elevated to a human right, it will deserve the highest protective status, and therefore, considerations of public policy are needed for data transfers, see Appendix D.</p>
            <p>R_5 highlights the current uncertainty businesses in the U.S. face regarding the lawfulness of data transfers between the EU and the U.S. rooted in the differences in regulation and data privacy approaches. With the invalidation of Privacy Shield, businesses are left with fewer mechanisms to share data, and are subjected to using standard contractual clauses that impose costs and potential liability on businesses, see Appendix E.</p>
            <p>R_6 explains how each jurisdiction will have vasty different requirements for protecting privacy and personal data that potentially causes inefficiencies also undermining the free flow of data. Although the CJEU notes that SCC are created to provide a uniform approach for controllers to use and rely on where the third country does not meet the EU’s standards for data protection. R_6 explains that data transfers are possible without an adequacy decision such as SCC but places a commercial and administrative burden on controllers so that data transfers to third countries comply with the GDPR, see Appendix F.</p>
            <p>R_7 speculates how the General Data Protection Regulation could have defused the problem of European citizens’ data being stored and evaluated according to U.S. R_7 however sees the influence of the extra-terrestrial applicability of the legislation, something that the U.S. was previously criticised for doing. R_7 explains the EU’s decision will apply its own law on other’s sovereign territory and so territorial effects of national law may contradict the principle of due diligence obligations but are still legitimate. R_7 say however these may have unintended effects, see Appendix G.</p>
            <p>R_9 explains how the Strasbourg judges argue the use of bulk data is necessary technique against times of terrorism and global crimes, see Appendix I.</p>
            <p>R_11 refers to Purtova, in which data protection had risked becoming “The Law of Everything” with the Court’s interpretation of personal data it would trigger a highly intensive non-scalable regime resulting from the GDPR that would be incapable of upholding in a meaningful way, see Appendix K.</p>
            <p>R_12 questions the impact of parliaments’ diplomatic actions and whether they are advisors or hold real political power. R_12 explains that it is impossible to determine due to the large variety of factors at play but points out that it influences is pursued with investigative action, blaming, and shaming and claims-making along with interparliamentary and executive meetings. R_16 observes that parliamentarians at times will achieve outcomes though political pressure caused from passing political verdicts on international affairs, see Appendix L.</p>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The start of the analysis begins with question one ‘What problems are created from U.S. foreign surveillance operations?’. One recuring theme found is the fear created by the U.S. surveillance operations. This fear has been described as ‘chilling’ and affects the online behaviour of internet users and develops an acceptance towards surveillance activities. This fear shows striking similarities to what the Panopticon seeks to achieve, and maybe that was the intention.</p>
            <p>Another theme presents itself in the uncertainty created from government surveillance, this includes uncertainty about the internal security of nations, and if the U.S. government agencies can ever be ‘bad actors’. Due to the secretive nature of surveillance, it is difficult to know if this could ever be true, and so this might be the cause of this idea and the accompanying scepticism associated with U.S. government agencies.</p>
            <p> The final theme identified, is the violation of privacy created from the use of internet surveillance operations, these violations have been found true within the Schrems cases and is arguably the main argument against the U.S. foreign surveillance practices in relation to the internet.</p>
            <p>The second half of this analysis focuses on question two ‘’ The EU and the U.S. have their own approaches to how they implement data protection and national security.</p>
            <p>A key theme was that third countries, most importantly the U.S. own sovereignty over their national security and government operations, including the use of internet surveillance operations. The standards set out by the EU can be viewed as restrictive, with international data transfers occurring only if that third country can provide the same and adequate protections particularly for personal information. With many papers suggesting some form of expansion of EU protection principles, it should be considered against the interests of the individual countries, and their ability to exercise sovereignty over their laws and government operations. This may have led to respondents expressing concern for the free flow of data, and the commercial and administrative burden given to controllers in which third countries cannot reach an adequacy decision to meet the EU standards on data protection.</p>
            <p>What does this mean for the aim of this paper? ‘Comparing problems created from EU data protection standards against problems created by U.S. foreign internet surveillance to suggest which side of argument should change’ to create a needed balance suitable for international transfers of data. Should the U.S. change to afford EU citizens with data protection equivalent to the standards set forth by EU data protection standards, including the GDPR. Or should the EU change, accepting U.S. internet surveillance operations used for nation security on EU citizens. Or is there something in between that is suitable enough for a successful agreement?</p>
            <p>This question is subjective, from a European citizens point of view, it is reasonable to suggest that they would be mostly against the U.S. foreign surveillance operations, this is demonstrated through the invalidation of both the CJEU’s invalidation of Safe Harbour and Privacy Shield in the Schrems cases. EU citizens worried about the infringement of their privacy, as suggested by the ‘chilling’ effects surveillance creates. Another party that may be against the operations of U.S. foreign internet surveillance are U.S. organisations and their controllers. As described by R_1 it can be seen by companies as allowing the U.S. to enter their property they create despite the efforts to secure that property from outsiders. </p>
            <p>On the other side of the argument, the use of U.S. surveillance operations is justifiable for the matters of national security. As explained by R_9, bulk data surveillance is necessary in time of terrorism and global threats. With the tensions between Russia growing as a product of the Ukraine-Russian conflict can the U.S. practically afford to sacrifice security to afford EU citizens the standard of protection expected from the EU for data protection and privacy. </p>
            <p> As pointed out in the judgement of Schrems II case, the legal remedies for European citizens kept under U.S. foreign surveillance activities where inadequate for providing remedies and redress in the chance that their personal data was misused. Perhaps an agreement could work by allowing the continuation for foreign surveillance for national security, while at the same time affording EU data subjects more avenues for redress and other benefits granted under EU data protection and privacy standards, including information requests of some sort. However, due to the secrecy of the surveillance programmes it might not be the case, due to the U.S. obligations to maintain state secrets and national security. 
                </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This dissertation was created to achieve its aim of figuring out which side of the argument wins when comparing the problems created on each side of the situation surrounding data transfers from the EU to the U.S.! This identifying that the EU is trying to achieve its own data protection standards and levels of privacy for European citizens when their data is transferred to the U.S., and the U.S. using foreign surveillance operations for the purposes of national security. </p>
            <p>Theories surrounding privacy and surveillance have been explored, including the privacy paradox, and the panopticon. Data transfers have been understood, through the exploration of case studies including Schrems cases and the various agreements made and invalidated between the U.S. and the EU.</p>
            <p>The research has revealed the different problems created by each side trying to achieve their goals and has revealed the answer is not black and white and to the extent that this holds true. It can be argued that neither side wins this argument when looking at the problems alone. The value of national security, data protection and privacy have not been assessed, and certainly research in this field would improve any answer to such a multifaceted and complicated situation.</p>
            <p>By identifying the ethical, legal, and economical problems, hopefully this research can be of value to policymakers and academics trying to work towards a successful agreement between the U.S. and the EU about data transfers, the right to privacy, and the need for national security.</p>
